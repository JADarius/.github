# Open Source Upstream

Welcome to the *Open Source Upstream* at the Computer Engineering School from
the University Politehnica of Bucharest.

We help students contribute to open source projects and try to convince companies to give
them a scholarship for that.

## For Students

If you are a student that wants to sign up for the program, take a look at our repositories here and fix an isssue
marked as *Good First Issue*. We will get back to you.

## For Mentors

If you would like to propose a project or mentor a student, send us an email 
at alexandru.radovici@upb.ro, ioana.culic@upb.ro 
or alexandru.vochescu@upb.ro.
